# Math App

## Description

This is a simple prototype for a basic addition math app. The idea is to help break down the steps for children learning addition.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the FreeCodeCamp community and particularly Randall for his generous help in refactoring and rebuilding bits that he felt weren't up to standard. I'd also like to thank the SoC slack community who I'm regularly dropping in on for tips and advice.

## Moving forward

Moving forward I'd like to create variations on this app for subtraction, multiplication and division.

## Using the App

I will be deploying the site at some point soon, but until then please feel free to do the following if you would like.

1. Clone the project
2. npm i
3. npm start

Enjoy!
